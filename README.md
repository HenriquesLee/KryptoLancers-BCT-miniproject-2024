# KryptoLancers - Ethereum-based Freelance Hiring Platform

KryptoLancers is a decentralized platform that allows clients to hire freelance engineering professionals using Ethereum-based transactions. It leverages **Streamlit** for the front-end interface and **Web3.py** for blockchain integration, enabling users to pay freelancers directly using Ether (ETH). 

This platform is connected to an Ethereum testnet (local Ganache in this case) and manages candidate selection, transaction handling, and balance retrieval seamlessly.

## Features:
- **Blockchain Integration**: Uses `web3.py` to interact with an Ethereum blockchain (Ganache).
- **Wallet Management**: Generate accounts, check balances, and send Ether transactions to freelancers.
- **Freelancer Information**: Displays a list of freelancers with their Ethereum addresses, ratings, hourly rates, and profile images.
- **Dynamic Background and Styling**: CSS and HTML are used to add dynamic visual elements to the Streamlit app.
- **Transaction Automation**: Calculates freelancer wages based on hours worked and sends Ether payments directly on the blockchain.
